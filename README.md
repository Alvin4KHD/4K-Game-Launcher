a Game Launcher used for Beans: Source

it's recommanded to use this launcher if your game is massive and you're doing only little changes to it
the game launcher doesn't include a updater for the game launcher currently.

This game launcher is rather meant for Younger developers that don't have 100$ to publish their games on steam

.Net Framework 4.8 required

also i'm not a good C# developer either, i actually added the strings so you don't search for anything in the code 

also i use .NET Because C++ (WinAPI) is too diffculty

also thanks to anyone that helped me even if i didn't ask for your code that is literally open source (especially the stackoverflow community
before you think "dude you stole 100% of the code"
wrong i combined it or smth, i'm not sure.
it's just a basic C# game launcher with a updater.
i don't even earn money with this.
